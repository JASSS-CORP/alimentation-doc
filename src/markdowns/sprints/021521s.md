*   First Sprint Meeting in class:
    *   App Idea:
        *   Shopping app that allows you to choose multiple (local) stores to shop from
        *   App automatically setups payments, delivery to each store
        *   Similar to Instacart
    *   Need to setup Authentication and payment for app
    *   We can use whatever services necessary, but requires to be not paid
    *   We can use AWS for database, hosting
    *   Need to plan and research what stack to use by Friday
